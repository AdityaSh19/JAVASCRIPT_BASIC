### Code Explanation and Interview Notes

1. **Basic `for` Loop:**

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
       const element = i;
       if (element == 5) {
           console.log("5 is best number");
       }
       console.log(element);
   }
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     0
     1
     2
     3
     4
     5 is best number
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
     10
     ```
   - **Explanation:** This `for` loop runs from `0` to `10`, and for each iteration, it checks if `element` is `5`. When it reaches `5`, it prints `"5 is best number"`. The loop then continues until `i` equals `10`.
   - **Interview Note:** A common question involves understanding loop control structures like `break` and `continue` and knowing how to access and check loop variables. Interviewers may also test your understanding of `const` and `let` scope within loops.

2. **Nested `for` Loops (Multiplication Table Example):**

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
       console.log(`Outer loop value: ${i}`);
       for (let j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
           console.log(`${i} * ${j} = ${i * j}`);
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Output:** This code will print a multiplication table from `1 * 1` to `10 * 10`.
   - **Explanation:** The outer loop (`i`) runs from `1` to `10`, and for each iteration of `i`, the inner loop (`j`) also runs from `1` to `10`. The result of `i * j` is calculated and printed for each pair.
   - **Interview Note:** Interviewers might ask for nested loop patterns or examples where each combination of two variables needs to be accessed. Understanding loop nesting is key, especially in cases of matrix manipulation or grid-based operations.

3. **Iterating Over Arrays with `for`:**

   ```javascript
   let myArray = ["flash", "batman", "superman"];
   for (let index = 0; index < myArray.length; index++) {
       const element = myArray[index];
       console.log(element);
   }
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     flash
     batman
     superman
     ```
   - **Explanation:** This loop iterates over `myArray` using `index`, accessing each superhero name by `myArray[index]`.
   - **Interview Note:** A key concept here is accessing array elements by index. Interviewers might ask for efficient ways to loop through arrays, comparing `for` with methods like `forEach` or `map`.

4. **Using `break` in Loops:**

   ```javascript
   for (let index = 1; index <= 20; index++) {
       if (index == 5) {
           console.log(`Detected 5`);
           break;
       }
       console.log(`Value of i is ${index}`);
   }
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     Value of i is 1
     Value of i is 2
     Value of i is 3
     Value of i is 4
     Detected 5
     ```
   - **Explanation:** The loop runs from `1` to `20`, but when `index` equals `5`, it prints `"Detected 5"` and stops further execution due to `break`.
   - **Interview Note:** `break` is useful to exit loops early, such as when searching for an item in an array. Interviewers might ask you to explain when and why to use `break` to optimize performance.

5. **Using `continue` in Loops:**

   ```javascript
   for (let index = 1; index <= 20; index++) {
       if (index == 5) {
           console.log(`Detected 5`);
           continue;
       }
       console.log(`Value of i is ${index}`);
   }
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     Value of i is 1
     Value of i is 2
     Value of i is 3
     Value of i is 4
     Detected 5
     Value of i is 6
     ...
     ```
   - **Explanation:** When `index` is `5`, it prints `"Detected 5"` and skips the remaining code in that loop iteration, moving to the next value without printing `5`.
   - **Interview Note:** `continue` is often used when a specific condition requires you to skip to the next iteration. Interviewers might ask you to explain scenarios where `continue` improves code readability or performance.
