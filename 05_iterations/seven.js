### Code Explanation and Interview Notes

1. **Chained Array Methods:**

   ```javascript
   const myNumers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

   const newNums = myNumers
                   .map((num) => num * 10)
                   .map((num) => num + 1)
                   .filter((num) => num >= 40);

   console.log(newNums);
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     [41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, 101]
     ```
   - **Explanation:** 
     - First `.map((num) => num * 10)` multiplies each element in `myNumers` by `10`, resulting in `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`.
     - The next `.map((num) => num + 1)` adds `1` to each element, yielding `[11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, 101]`.
     - Finally, `.filter((num) => num >= 40)` keeps only numbers `>= 40`, resulting in `[41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, 101]`.
   - **Interview Note:** Understanding chained methods like `map` and `filter` is crucial. Interviewers may ask you to optimize or explain the flow of data transformations in chained methods, or they may test your knowledge by asking about the order of operations. 

2. **Method Details:**
   - **`map()`**: Transforms each element in the array. `map` returns a new array of the same length.
   - **`filter()`**: Returns a new array with only elements that match the given condition. `filter` does not alter elements but can reduce the array length.
   - **Interview Tip:** `map` and `filter` are non-mutative, meaning they donâ€™t change the original array. Knowing which methods mutate versus create new arrays is valuable in JavaScript development.

3. **Performance and Readability:**
   - Using multiple `.map()` calls can make code readable for small transformations, but chaining too many can reduce performance. Consolidating transformations into a single `map` where possible is more efficient.
   - **Interview Tip:** If optimization is important, interviewers may ask if there are alternative approaches to avoid multiple passes through the array.
