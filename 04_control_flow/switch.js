### Code Explanation:

```javascript
const month = "march";

switch (month) {
    case "jan":
        console.log("January");
        break;
    case "feb":
        console.log("feb");
        break;
    case "march":
        console.log("march");
        break;
    case "april":
        console.log("april");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("default case match");
        break;
}
```

### Output:

- Since `month` is `"march"`, it will match the `case "march":` condition.
- **Output:** `march`

### Interview Notes:

1. **Switch-Case Structure:** 
   - A `switch` statement evaluates an expression, matching its value to a specified `case`. If a match is found, it executes the associated code block.
   - The `break` statement is essential to exit the `switch` after a match; otherwise, the code will "fall through" and execute subsequent cases, regardless of whether they match.

2. **Default Case:**
   - The `default` case is optional but recommended. It runs if no matching `case` is found, providing a fallback.
   - **Good Practice:** Ensure every switch block has a `default` case to handle unexpected values.

3. **Best Use Cases:**
   - `switch` is best for checking a single variable against multiple known values.
   - Itâ€™s often preferred over multiple `if-else` statements when the conditions are straightforward and involve simple equality checks.

4. **Strict Comparison:** 
   - A `switch` performs strict comparison (`===`), so `case "march"` only matches if `month` is exactly `"march"`.

**Additional Interview Tip:** 
An interviewer might ask how `switch` compares to `if-else` and where one might be preferable over the other. Switch statements are typically more readable for scenarios with several specific cases.
